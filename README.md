- ### 1. Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
What's better: more cores or high speed on a CPU ? That all depends on what you will need it for . For most people it will be speed since that means the application can run and load faster. But if you are a video editor ,data analyst and other similar fields you should get at least 6 since you will be processing a lot of information .A computer can run well with 2 or 4 cores if you're not doing anything too demanding .
 ### 2. What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
You'll want to select a motherboard which is compatible with your processor, which can be accomplished by checking the socket of the CPU and motherboard.
### 3. What are the trade offsyoud evaluate while selecting a storage device ?
 * Your average HDD has a speed of 7200 RPM.
 * HDDs can also use IDE instead of SATA as their connections, but SATA is newer and thus supported on all modern motherboards
 * The added benefits of an SSD also come with a higher price tag.
 * Many PC users choose a relatively small capacity (200-500GB) SSD to use as their boot drive (the drive the operating system runs on), and then use a larger (500GB-1TB) HDD for their files. This makes the computer run much faster, as the operating system will benefit from the increased speeds of the SSD.
### 4. Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way theyâ€™d best connect with?
I would explain the key parts to fellow vets as if the motherboard was the full military and all the other components inside are different units with different MOSs doing different jobs. Ones saving the information, the other is processing information while another could be keeping everything cool and running.
